# Cuckoo Hashing

This is an implementation in Rust of a d-ary [cuckoo hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuckoo_hashing) with stash. This implementation is based on the implementation done by [Utkan Güngördü](https://github.com/salviati) in Golang. You can find the implementation [here](https://github.com/salviati/cuckoo).

There are a couple of differences in this implementation, with the most notable one being the use of bitmaps instead of using zero as a placeholder for empty cells in the map. What Uktan did with zero is smart but I thought it would be a good exercise to  build it without the trick, there's probably a small performance penalty but that's fine.

A hashmap based on Cuckoo Hashing is something covered a lot in CS  courses. You can find plenty of information about it on the web, below you can check some of the resources I used for this project.

You can also take a look to the source code, if you want to implement Cuckoo Hashing as a way to learn using Rust, I'd suggest to try and follow the Golang implementation as I did and take a look at this implementation if you feel stuck on something.

I'm pretty sure most of the things I did, could have been implemented in a better way, especially a number of clone operations that can be found in the code. If you have any suggestions on how the code can be improved, please let me know!

TODO: Implement iterators to iterate over keys and (k,v). This will be a good exercise in implementing iterators in Rust.
